# Handling Responses

`ElasticsearchResponse<T>` is the container return type for all API calls. It has the following properties:

### Success
The call succeeded and was succesful (200 range). 
Note that even if you get a 200 back from Elasticsearch, in many cases it's still recommended 
to check the actual response making sure it succeeded on enough shards.

### Error
When a call succeeds but does not return a HTTP status code of 200 this property will have details on the error.
[Read more about error handling here](/elasticsearch-net/errors.html).
### HttpStatusCode
The HTTP status code that the call returned.

### OriginalException
Holds the exception that occurred on the Elasticsearch server.  Null if no exception occurred.

### ServerError
The original exception from the Elasticsearch server mapped as an `ElasticsearchServerError`, otherwise null.

### RequestMethod
The HTTP method used for making the request (POST, GET, PUT, HEAD, DELETE).

### RequestUrl
The URL the request was sent to.

### Request 
The `byte[]` request that was sent to Elasticsearch.

### ResponseRaw 
A `byte[]` representation of the response from Elasticsearch, only set when `ExposeRawResponses()` is set. 
See the [Connecting section](/elasticearch-net/connecting.html).

### Response
The deserialized `T` object representing the response.

### Metrics
Meta data returned on the response, if `EnableMetrics` is set, otherwise null.  See the [Connecting section](/elasticearch-net/connecting.html).

### NumberOfRetries
The number of times the request was tried.

## Typed API Calls

`Elasticsearch.Net` does not provide typed objects representing the responses. This is up to the developer to map. 

    var result = client.Search<MyType>()

In this example `MyType` is a type you provide to deserialize Elasticsearch's response to. 

    var myTypeInstance = client.Response

If you specify `T` as `string` or `byte[]` the response will not go through the registered `ISerializer` but simply read and returned.

    var result = client.Search<string>();
    var stringResponse = result.Response;

This can be handy if you want to inspect the json dynamically by passing it into `JSON.NET`'s `JObject`. However `Elasticsearch.Net` also 
supports dynamic usecases out of the box.

## Dynamic API Calls

If you do not provide an explicit `<T>` for your return type `Elasticsearch.Net` will deserialize into a `DynamicDictionary`[\*]

    var result = client.Search();
    int? myInt = result.Response
        .hits.hits[2].nestedObject["someOtherValue"].myInt;

This will try and read `hits.hits[2].nestedObject.someOtherValue.myInt` from the search response and it won't throw null binding exceptions if i.e `nestedObject` does not exist in the second hit. 

This is really great for exploratory programming but dynamic dispatch in C# is not the fastest part of the language. It's highly recommended you try and map 
responses to an explicit object instead.

\* DynamicDictionary comes from the [Nancyfx](http://nancyfx.org/) project but is slightly modified to support arbitrary call depths without null checks in between.
